# art-contest

This is the code for the art contest in the r/JaidenAnimations server.

Please note that this is **not** production quality code. Due to the timing and templates i used, getting this thing into a proper state was not feasible.

I only need(ed) to keep this code usable until the art contest was finished.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
