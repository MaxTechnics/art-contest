# art-contest

This is the code for the art contest in the r/JaidenAnimations server.

Please note that this is **not** production quality code. Due to the timing and templates i used, getting this thing into a proper state was not feasible.

The only thing that is at least in a 'presentable' state, is the server process. I put this all in a single file because i didn't think it would be so much code, and i wanted to keep as much of the server itself contained.

I only need(ed) to keep this code usable until the art contest was finished.
